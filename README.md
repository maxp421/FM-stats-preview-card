## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

During this project I learned how to make color overlays with a background-image and a linear gradient, learned more about grid and flexbox and discovered the css property aspect-ratio and learned more about the css function clamp(). 

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about accessibility, aria labels and proper practices. I would also like to learn more about mobile-first design, Tailwind and SASS.
